1 Chronicles 16:23-26
Sing to the LORD, all the earth;
proclaim his salvation day after day.
Declare his glory among the nations,
his marvelous deeds among all peoples.
For great is the LORD and most worthy of praise;
he is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the nations are idols,
but the LORD made the heavens.

Come, now is the time to worship.
Come, now is the time to give your heart.

Come, just as you are before your God.
Come.

<h3>PP 55: Forever Reign</h3>
1. You are good, You are good,
when there's nothing good in me.
You are love, You are love,
on display for all to see.
You are light, You are light,
when the darkness closes in.
You are hope, You are hope,
You have covered all my sin.
</section>
<section>
2. You are peace, You are peace,
when my fear is crippling.
You are true, You are true,
even in my wandering.
You are joy, You are joy,
You're the reason that I sing.
You are life, You are life,
in You death has lost its sting.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh, I'm running to Your arms,
I'm running to Your arms.
The riches of Your love
will always be enough.
Nothing compares to Your embrace.
Light of the world, forever reign.
</section>
<section>
3. You are more, You are more,
than my words will ever say.
You are Lord, You are Lord,
all creation will proclaim.
You are here, You are here,
in Your presence I'm made whole.
You are God, you are God,
of all else I'm letting go.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh, I'm running to Your arms,
I'm running to Your arms.
The riches of Your love
will always be enough.
Nothing compares to Your embrace.
Light of the world, forever reign.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
My heart will sing,
no other Name.
Jesus, Jesus.
My heart will sing,
no other Name.
Jesus, Jesus.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh, I'm running to Your arms,
I'm running to Your arms.
The riches of Your love
will always be enough.
Nothing compares to Your embrace.
Light of the world, forever reign.

Proverbs 1:1-7
The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
for attaining wisdom and discipline;
for understanding words of insight;
for acquiring a disciplined and prudent life,
doing what is right and just and fair;
</section>
<section class=smaller>
for giving prudence to the simple, 
knowledge and discretion to the young—
let the wise listen and add to their learning, 
and let the discerning get guidance—
for understanding proverbs and parables, 
the sayings and riddles of the wise.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,
but fools despise wisdom and discipline.

Romans 4:1-8
What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter?
If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about—but
not before God. What does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was
credited to him as righteousness.”
</section>
<section class=smaller>
Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an
obligation. However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies
the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness. David says the same thing
when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness
apart from works:
</section>
<section class=smaller>
“Blessed are they
whose transgressions are forgiven,
whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the man
whose sin the Lord will never count against him.”

<h3>PP 19: Speak, O Lord</h3>
1. Speak, O Lord, as we come to You
To receive the food of Your Holy Word.
Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;
Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,
That the light of Christ might be seen today
In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us 
All Your purposes for Your glory.
</section>
<section>
2. Teach us, Lord, full obedience,
Holy reverence, true humility;
Test our thoughts and our attitudes
In the radiance of Your purity.
Cause our faith to rise; cause our eyes to see
Your majestic love and authority.
Words of pow’r that can never fail -
Let their truth prevail over unbelief.
</section>
<section>
3. Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;
Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us -
Truths unchanged from the dawn of time
That will echo down through eternity.
And by grace we’ll stand on Your promises,
And by faith we’ll walk as You walk with us.
Speak, O Lord, till Your church is built
And the earth is filled with Your glory.

<h3>PP 56: Above All</h3>
1. Above all powers, above all kings,
above all nature and all created things;
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man,
You were here before the world began.
</section>
<section>
2. Above all kingdoms, above all thrones,
above all wonders the world has ever known;
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth,
there's no way to measure what You're worth.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Crucified, laid behind the stone;
You lived to die, rejected and alone;
Like a rose, trampled on the ground,
You took the fall, and though of me,
above all.
