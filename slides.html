<h3>PP 61: Come, Now Is The Time To Worship</h3>
<i>
Come, now is the time to worship.
Come, now is the time to give your heart.
Come, just as you are to worship.
Come, just as you are before your God.
Come.
</i>

<section>
1. One day every tongue will confess You are God.
One day every knee will bow.
Still the greatest treasure remains for those
who gladly choose You now.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Come, now is the time to worship.
Come, now is the time to give your heart.
Come, just as you are to worship.
Come, just as you are before your God.
Come.
</section>
<section>
2. Willingly we choose to surrender our lives.
Willingly our knees will bow.
With all our heart, soul, mind, and strength
we gladly choose you now.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Come, now is the time to worship.
Come, now is the time to give your heart.
Come, just as you are to worship.
Come, just as you are before your God.
Come.

Come, just as you are before your God.
Come.

<h3>PP 55: Forever Reign</h3>
1. You are good, You are good,
when there's nothing good in me.
You are love, You are love,
on display for all to see.
You are light, You are light,
when the darkness closes in.
You are hope, You are hope,
You have covered all my sin.
</section>
<section>
2. You are peace, You are peace,
when my fear is crippling.
You are true, You are true,
even in my wandering.
You are joy, You are joy,
You're the reason that I sing.
You are life, You are life,
in You death has lost its sting.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh, I'm running to Your arms,
I'm running to Your arms.
The riches of Your love
will always enough.
Nothing compares to Your embrace.
Light of the world, forever reign.
</section>
<section>
3. You are more, You are more,
than my words will ever say.
You are Lord, You are Lord,
all creation will proclaim.
You are here, You are here,
in Your presence I'm made whole.
You are God, you are God,
of all else I'm letting go.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh, I'm running to Your arms,
I'm running to Your arms.
The riches of Your love
will always enough.
Nothing compares to Your embrace.
Light of the world, forever reign.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
My heart will sing,
no other Name.
Jesus, Jesus.
My heart will sing,
no other Name.
Jesus, Jesus.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Oh, I'm running to Your arms,
I'm running to Your arms.
The riches of Your love
will always enough.
Nothing compares to Your embrace.
Light of the world, forever reign.

<h3>PP 19: Speak, O Lord</h3>
1. Speak, O Lord, as we come to You
To receive the food of Your Holy Word.
Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;
Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,
That the light of Christ might be seen today
In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us 
All Your purposes for Your glory.
</section>
<section>
2. Teach us, Lord, full obedience,
Holy reverence, true humility;
Test our thoughts and our attitudes
In the radiance of Your purity.
Cause our faith to rise; cause our eyes to see
Your majestic love and authority.
Words of pow’r that can never fail -
Let their truth prevail over unbelief.
</section>
<section>
3. Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;
Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us -
Truths unchanged from the dawn of time
That will echo down through eternity.
And by grace we’ll stand on Your promises,
And by faith we’ll walk as You walk with us.
Speak, O Lord, till Your church is built
And the earth is filled with Your glory.

<h3>PP 56: Above All</h3>
1. Above all powers, above all kings,
above all nature and all created things;
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man,
You were here before the world began.
</section>
<section>
2. Above all kingdoms, above all thrones,
above all wonders the world has ever known;
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth,
there's no way to measure what You're worth.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
Crucified, laid behind the stone;
You lived to die, rejected and alone;
Like a rose, trampled on the ground,
You took the fall, and though of me,
above all.

<h3>PP 57: Offering</h3>
1. Magnificent, holy Father,
I stand in awe of all I see.
Of all the things You have created
and still You choose to think of me.
</section>
<section>
And who am I that You should suffer
Your very life to set me free?
The only thing that I can give you
is the life You gave to me.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
This is my offering, dear Lord.
This is my offering, to You, God.
And I will give You my life
for it's all I have to give
because You gave Your life for me.
</section>
<section>
2. I stand before You at this altar.
So many have given You more.
I may not have much I can offer,
yet what I have is truly Yours.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
This is my offering, dear Lord.
This is my offering, to You, God.
And I will give You my life
for it's all I have to give
because You gave Your life for me.
