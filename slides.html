Isaiah 29:13
The Lord says:
“These people come near to me with their mouth
and honor me with their lips,
but their hearts are far from me.
Their worship of me
is made up only of rules taught by men.”

<section>
<h3>PP 58: Psalm 62</h3>
1. My soul finds rest in God alone,
My rock and my salvation.
A fortress strong against my foes,
and I will not be shaken.
Though lips may bless and hearts may curse,
and lies like arrows pierce me
I'll fix my heart on righteousness,
I'll look to him who hears me.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
O praise him, hallelujah,
my delight and my reward.
Everlasting, never failing,
my Redeemer, my God.
</section>
<section>
2. Find rest, my soul in God alone,
amid the world's temptations.
When evil seeks to take a hold,
I'll cling to my salvation.
Though riches come and riches go,
don't set your heart upon them.
The fields of hope in which I sow
are harvested in heaven.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
O praise him, hallelujah,
my delight and my reward.
Everlasting, never failing,
my Redeemer, my God.
</section>
<section>
3. I'll set my gaze on God alone,
and trust in Him completely,
With every day pour out my soul
and He will prove His mercy.
Though life is but a fleeting breath,
a sigh too brief to measure,
My King has crushed the curse of death
and I am His forever.
</section>
<section class=refrain>
O praise him, hallelujah,
my delight and my reward.
Everlasting, never failing,
my Redeemer, my God.

<h3>PP 57: Offering</h3>

I stand in awe of all I see.
Of all the things You have created
and still You choose to think of me.
